                <h3>Deep Learning-Based Image Recognition Project: A Neural Network Approach</h3>
                <p>    This project focuses on developing a deep learning-based image recognition system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The primary objective is to classify images into predefined categories with high accuracy by leveraging advanced neural network architectures.
                    
                    We utilized a dataset consisting of thousands of labeled images across multiple categories, preprocessing the data through normalization, augmentation, and resizing techniques to enhance model robustness. The core model was built using a CNN, incorporating layers such as convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers, optimized using activation functions like ReLU and Softmax. To improve performance, we experimented with different architectures, including ResNet, VGG, and EfficientNet, fine-tuning hyperparameters and employing transfer learning where applicable.
                    
                    The model was trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with adaptive learning rate techniques like Adam optimizer, and loss functions such as cross-entropy. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, were used to assess model performance on both training and validation datasets. The final system demonstrated high classification accuracy and was successfully deployed as an application, showcasing the effectiveness of deep learning in image recognition tasks.</p>
