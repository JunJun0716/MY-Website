                <h3>🌍 Who Am I?</h3>
                <p>Hi, I’m Li Junpu, a passionate Computer Science student currently studying in the U.S. I grew up in a beautiful coastal city in China, where I developed a deep love for the ocean. My hometown’s endless waves and golden beaches have shaped my curiosity and creativity, always inspiring me to explore the unknown.
                    "The ocean is more than just water; it's a symbol of infinite possibilities."</p>
